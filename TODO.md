## Licensing
(all "links" are github)

Two repositories (french-paragon/BayesianMnist and Riashat/Deep-Bayesian-Active-Learning) don't have licenses --- how can we use their code?

Other stuff (kumar-shridhar/PyTorch-BayesianCNN and IzzyBrand/PyTorch\_BatchBALD) are MIT, we can just add those notices to the main notice
